## **Project Choice**
Option B: Bread of Life

## **Team**
  * Dennis Bogdanov
  * Melyssa Navarro
  * Muaz Sajid 

## **Modules Needed**
  * npm install express
  * npm install mongoose
  * npm install morgan
  * npm install dotenv
  * npm install mongoose-auto-increment
  * *npm install nodemon* -this should be optional

## **How To Run**
In a terminal make sure you are under the "../backend" directory, then execute one of the following:

**With Nodemon**

*nodemon server.js*

**With node.js**

*node server.js*

## **Samples**
Included in the repository is a 'Samples' folder. This folder contains a Postman file which can be imported into Postman - this file contains (hopefully) functioning HTTP requests to the backend API. 

Additionally included is a sampleData file which contains, as the name of the file suggests, sample data. There is not a way to import this data directly through a bulk insert of sorts, but it should give you a good idea of what our data structure looks like. This data can be used alongside the above mentioned HTTP requests inside Postman to test the API.
